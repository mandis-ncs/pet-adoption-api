# pet-adoption-api
Pet Adoption API created with Spring Boot as an example in a quickly workshop of Compass UOL, tutored by the instructor Oswaldo.

### Some new contents: 
JpaRepository, Lombok, Validation, UriComponentsBuilder, DTO Concept, Record class

### New annotations: 
@Slf4j, @RequiredArgsConstructor, @NotNull and @NotBlank validations

## Difficulty
Building the project with Gradle... The first time I ran the code, it returned: "adopet does not contain a Gradle build".
To resolve this, I opened the Gradle menu in the right sidebar (near the Maven menu), chose "Execute Gradle Task", and added "gradle.init" and "build.gradle". After that, I reloaded the main file.
